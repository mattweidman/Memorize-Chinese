# Memorize Chinese

This is a React application used to help me memorize Chinese characters.

The webpage includes a grid with three columns: hanzi (Chinese characters), pinyin (Chinese pronunciations), and English. Cells across the same row have the same meaning. Two cells are randomly blanked out in each row. The goal for the user is to fill in every blank cell correctly.

Vocabulary data for each quiz is stored in a JSON format. This application allows the user to switch between different quiz JSONs. See src/data for example JSONs.

### Running

Enter `npm start` in the command prompt.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
